Understanding Data Flow in a Spring Boot Application: From Postman Client to Controller, Service, and Response"

In a Spring Boot application, the flow of data typically starts with a Postman client sending an HTTP request to the Controller Layer. The controller processes the request by invoking the appropriate methods in the Service Layer, where business logic is applied. The service layer retrieves or processes the required data and returns it to the controller. The controller, in turn, sends the response back to Postman, which displays the data. This layered architecture helps in maintaining separation of concerns, ensuring that each layer handles a specific task. The controller focuses on handling HTTP requests, while the service layer deals with business logic. This setup provides a clear and efficient way to structure web applications, especially when dealing with RESTful APIs in Spring Boot.
